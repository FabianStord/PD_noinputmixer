# PD_noinputmixer
No-Input Mixer recreated in Pure Data using feedback loops
This is an emulation of a no-input mixer using feedback loops
Choose what frequencies you want to use using the number boxes above the osc~ objects. 
Set the input volume for each oscilator and noise
Choose a delay time and amount of feedback (NB be very carefull using high feedback numbers. I've included both a limiter and clipper control the volume)
Set the volume of the individual sounds and the overall and main volume
